Hello /r/audioengineering, I am trying to learn techniques to improve voiceover quality, particularly in post processing, but perhaps in vocal technique. I am currently using a Blue Snowball USB microphone, but plan on upgrading that to something more serious this year. I will probably build myself a little sound booth as well. I use Audacity for recording and processing but I have access to Sony SoundForge Pro through work if I need it. I don't know if I'm in the right subreddit, but any advic. So on a song that I am working on I have about 10 vocal tracks playing at once and I've noticed that it's impossible to get some of them to cut through the mix and become audible. It seems like there is too much going on and that the input it too "hot" for the mixer to handle. In other words, when I turned down some of the vocal tracks, the other tracks actually get louder. Is there anything that I can do to fix this problem? Also, if you use Reason, what's your recording process like? I curre. I have some records I want to digitize for my grandpa. I have a Pro-Ject Debut Carbon and a Behringer PP400 preamp, which has both RCA and 1/4 in headphone outputs. I have both Audacity and Sony's Sound Forge software. When i connected the 1/4 jack to the mic input on my computer, nothing was heard by my computer. I'm sorry I don't speak much computer lingo, but I would love your help. Thanks. My name is Nicolas and I am looking for work in radio, podcasting or customer service. I hold a Bachelors of Art in Multimedia from The University of Advancing Technology.

Hey guys, I'm currently working on "unmuddying" some audio I lifted off poorly encoded videos. I can't get a higher quality recording because it was a live performance, so I'm trying to "fix it" with my audio editor (Sony Sound Forge Pro 10.0). The problem I run into is distinguishing the difference between the unedited and equalized audio because my editor either does the processing in real-time (transition is choppy/unnatural) or has to process the entire file (takes way too long).
