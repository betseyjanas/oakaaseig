If you put your images in res/drawable, Android assumes they're for 160dpi and scales them accordingly for different resolutions. Your options are either to put the button images into res/drawable-hdpi signaling that they're intended for densities around 240dpi, or into res/drawable-nodpi to make them never scale regardless of the current screen density. –ë–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –®—Ç—Ä–∏—Ö–∫–æ–¥–æ–≤. –í—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —ç—Ç–æ—Ç –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä —à—Ç—Ä–∏—Ö–∫–æ–¥–æ–≤, –∫–∞–∫ —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –í–∞—à–µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ–º–º–µ—Ä—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ–±.

The system may dim and shrink status bar icons to allow users to focus on the foreground activity. For example, in Android 4.0, the platform-standard status bar for handset-size devices reduces icons to 18 x 18 dip and 40% opacity in the status bar, while drawing them full-size and at full intensity in the expanded notification panel. –ù–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∏–≤–∞–µ–º–æ–µ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –í—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç—å –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Å–∂–∞—Ç–∏—è, –≤–ª–∏—è—è –Ω–∞ –∞–ª–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–º —Å–∂–∞—Ç–∏—è, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å –∏–¥–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç. Android runs on a variety of devices that have different screen sizes and pixel densities.

Why This is The Best Measuring Tool? All you need is one finger, 0 on Apple devices or 0 on Android and less than 15 minutes to master. So, realising I must move away from W10M, the only option is Apple. I always hated iPhone but Google is a no go for me. Since I have no idea about Apple phones, I fired up a comparison page to see the differences size-wise (physically). Then I scrolled and noticed the dpi of my XL from the middle ages is STILL HIGHER than the latest greatest Apple. Dell P2715Q ( 4K (3840 x 2160) IPS display with 60hz refresh rate. BenQ XL2420G ( 1080p TN panel with 144Hz refresh rate and G-Sync My rig: Intel i5-4690K @ 4.5Ghz paired with Nvidia 980 Ti reference @ 1200Mhz (also had an R9 295x2 @ 4K for a couple weeks) Full build ( For performance reference using Firestrike bench. In the blog "Introducing the New Firefox: Firefox Quantum" Mozilla boasts about how Firefox Quantum is so fast. "The first thing you'll notice is the speed. Go on, open some tabs and have some fun." I understand that this refers to how quickly stuff loads, and that this is targeted to Firefox for PC. However, on Android, tab switching is so clunky. When people have brought this up on bugzilla they have given suggestions such as to use a tablet (it displays a tab bar on tablets), or change. Is it possible to have GBDPI for Android? Will it ever be developed. Source: Link to Kairos Website: https://kairoswatches.com/ It seems that the transparent OLED screen on the Kairos does not have sufficient resolution (pixel density?) to meet Android Wear requirements. It's disappointing to hear this since I was kind of looking forward to a mechanical smartwatch with Android Wear. gt We had a meeting with Google at their head office. Unfortunately 
Is there a tweak to change de DPI of the iphone X? I would like everything a little smaller to use a lot more screen real state. I know this probably isn't the correct place to ask this however as a QA i'm turning to my QA community as I know someone here can help :) I'm putting together a device support matrix to act a barrier when it comes to troubleshooting certain bugs on certain devices. iOS is easy, but i'm having a hard time with Android. Android accounts for lt5% of downloads, and while I have very good data on what phones are being used, there are A TON of them. So i've narrowed it down to the following. EDIT: Didn't notice that unrated/underated typoü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇ I wish Google would implement this natively on Android. I know you can do it with root via buidprop edit and Samsung's Experience skin has this, but it would be nice to have this across all Android devices. Just like how multi-window was a TouchWiz thing and Google ended up implementing that feature natively. Is there a go to ‚Äúcheap‚Äù Parsec client that people prefer? Such as a NUC, Pi or other thin client machine? Goals are the following: - low cost - H265 is a must - Preferred support for VirtualHere (Logitech Steering Wheels), though this requirement isn‚Äôt 100% necessary - Small form factor preferred Raspberry Pi is great, but a hair underpowered (and is H264 only). The lack of H265 support on Linux makes choosing a cheap thin client difficult, and it‚Äôs unclear if/when H265 Linux support. I use my Pixelbook at 1800x1200, but that means most of the Android apps I use have terribly scaled UI elements. Is what I'm looking for achievable? I'm happy with any solution, be it in flags, developer options, different release channel, etc. Thanks. 
If I try to use 780 or 1080 resolution options, OpenAuto works but does not use the full width of the screen. Is there an easy fix for this? I used OpenAuto a while back and was able to use the full screen with both of those modes in the past. Has something changed now? Besides using limited width, all other functions work as normal. Using Nexus 6 on Raspberry PI with official 7 inch touchscreen. Screenshots here (https://imgur.com/gallery/q4L2wwW). Hey guys, I had an Android dev build a small app for Android TV that shows a webpage as the screensaver. All is great it works really well, apart from the resolution of the screensaver seems to be stuck at 960x540, on a 4K screen that looks pretty poor. He's stumped and me being only a front end web guy can't seem to figure it out. amp#x200B; If anyone could point me in the right direction I'd be very grateful. amp#x200B; Thanks! amp#x200B; Edit: Android Studio Hello fellow internet folks! Today I would like to offer a guide for those of you battling firewalls and DPI. You can set up an OpenVPN server with Obfsproxy to bypass firewalls such as the Great China Firewall. This is the link to my tutorial for those who want to set this up. (https://bustedsocket.com/tutorials/2017/11/how-to-set-up-openvpn-with-obfsproxy.php) ## Why am I posting this? It took me about 3 weeks figuring out all the steps to get this working, with a repeatable list of tasks.
